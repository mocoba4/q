Automated Website Monitor with Login + Telegram Alerts (GitHub Actions)
1. ROLE & RESPONSIBILITY OF THE AI AGENT

You are an autonomous software engineer AI agent.

Your job is to:

Design

Implement

Configure

Document

Deploy

A fully working automation app based on the requirements below.

⚠️ IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS

The user is not technical

Do NOT ask the user to make architectural or technical decisions

Only ask the user for:

Login email

Login password

Telegram Bot Token

Telegram Chat ID

Everything else must be handled by you

The user should only need to copy-paste values, not code

2. GOAL OF THE APP (PLAIN ENGLISH)

Create an app that:

Runs automatically every 5 minutes

Opens the website
👉 https://example.invalid/modeling-requests

If redirected, logs in at
👉 https://example.invalid/users/login

Maintains login if possible

Re-logs in only if session expired

Once the page loads, checks for this exact phrase:

Looks like all tasks were picked up before you


If the phrase IS FOUND

Do nothing

If the phrase IS NOT FOUND

Send a Telegram message immediately

Runs entirely in the cloud

The user’s PC must NOT stay on

Uses ONLY free services

Uses a public GitHub repository

Keeps email, password, URLs, and tokens secret

NO secrets inside code

NO secrets committed to GitHub

3. REQUIRED TECHNOLOGY (MANDATORY)

You MUST use:

GitHub (Public Repository)

GitHub Actions (cron every 5 minutes)

Node.js

Playwright (headless browser automation)

Telegram Bot API

❌ Do NOT use:

Paid services

External schedulers

Cloud VMs

Docker (unless absolutely required)

Anything requiring the user’s PC to stay on

4. SECURITY REQUIREMENTS (VERY IMPORTANT)
4.1 Secrets Handling (MANDATORY)

The following MUST NOT be inside the repository:

Website URLs

Login email

Login password

Telegram Bot Token

Telegram Chat ID

Target phrase

All of these must be stored as:

GitHub Repository → Settings → Secrets → Actions


You MUST:

Read them via environment variables

Mask them in logs

Never print them

5. LOGIN BEHAVIOR REQUIREMENTS

The app MUST:

Attempt to open:

https://example.invalid/modeling-requests


If redirected to login:

https://example.invalid/users/login


→ Perform login automatically

After login:

Navigate back to /modeling-requests

Wait until page is fully loaded

Session Handling

If cookies/session exist → reuse them

If session expired → login again

If session storage is not possible across runs → re-login every run (acceptable)

⚠️ The AI must decide the best approach automatically.

6. CHECKING LOGIC (EXACT)

After the page loads:

Extract page content

Search for the exact string:

Looks like all tasks were picked up before you

Behavior:
Condition	Action
Phrase found	Exit silently
Phrase NOT found	Send Telegram alert
7. TELEGRAM NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS

If phrase is NOT found, send a Telegram message containing:

Clear alert message

Timestamp (UTC)

Website name

Example message:

🚨 CGTrader Alert
The phrase was NOT found on the modeling requests page.
Time: 2025-01-01 14:05 UTC


Telegram must be used because:

Free

Reliable

Instant

8. GITHUB ACTIONS REQUIREMENTS
8.1 Schedule

You MUST configure GitHub Actions with:

*/5 * * * *


This runs every 5 minutes (UTC).

8.2 Runner

Use ubuntu-latest

Linux runner only (cheapest / fastest)

8.3 Failure Handling

If the script crashes → send Telegram error alert

If login fails → send Telegram error alert

If page structure changes → send Telegram alert

9. FILE STRUCTURE (MANDATORY)

You MUST create the following structure:

repo-root/
│
├── checker/
│   ├── index.js
│   ├── package.json
│
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/
│       └── checker.yml
│
└── README.md

10. README REQUIREMENTS (FOR NON-TECHNICAL USER)

The README MUST include:

What this app does (simple English)

How to set it up (step-by-step, copy-paste)

How to add secrets

How to test manually

How alerts work

What to do if login breaks

No jargon. Assume zero technical background.

11. WHAT YOU ARE ALLOWED TO ASK THE USER

You MAY ask the user ONLY for:

Email address for login

Password for login

Telegram Bot Token

Telegram Chat ID

You must explain exactly how to obtain them, step by step.

❌ Do NOT ask:

Which framework to use

Which architecture to choose

Whether to use cookies or not

Any programming decisions

12. RELIABILITY & ROBUSTNESS

You MUST:

Wait for page to fully load

Handle slow connections

Retry navigation if needed

Avoid false negatives

Avoid duplicate Telegram messages in the same run

13. FINAL ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

The task is complete only when:

✅ Repo is public
✅ No secrets are visible in code
✅ GitHub Actions runs every 5 minutes
✅ Login works automatically
✅ Phrase detection works correctly
✅ Telegram alerts arrive instantly
✅ User never touches code

14. IMPORTANT FINAL NOTE TO AI

You are expected to:

Make reasonable assumptions

Choose best-practice defaults

Handle edge cases proactively

Act like a senior engineer

If something is impossible, explain it clearly and propose the closest possible solution without asking the user to design it.Automated Website Monitor with Login + Telegram Alerts (GitHub Actions)
