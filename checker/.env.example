# Set CHECK_ONLY=1 to disable auto-accept (Notifications only)
# CHECK_ONLY=1
CHECK_INTERVAL=10

# --- Optional: Fast "nuclear" accept (single POST request) ---
# When enabled, workers skip UI clicking and instead send ONE request:
# POST /modeling-requests/<id>/update-status?status=accepted
# Using per-account cookies + x-csrf-token, and JSON body with round_deadline.
# round_deadline is taken from the available-requests feed field: attributes.nextRoundDeadline
# NUCLEAR_ACCEPT=1

# Optional: add spacing between nuclear accepts (ms). Defaults to 50-100ms random.
# NUCLEAR_ACCEPT_DELAY_MIN_MS=50
# NUCLEAR_ACCEPT_DELAY_MAX_MS=100

# --- Optional: global per-account max tasks to hold ---
# These caps apply to ALL accounts and limit how many tasks you will accept per type,
# regardless of the UI capacity max.
# Example: if UI shows 6/12 grouped and MAX_TAKE_GROUPED=8, the bot will accept only 2 more grouped tasks.
# Set to blank or 0 to disable.
# MAX_TAKE_SINGLE=0
# MAX_TAKE_GROUPED=0

# --- Optional: Accept/Confirm request tracing (redacted) ---
# If enabled, on failed job attempts the bot sends a Telegram document containing
# a redacted XHR/fetch trace (endpoints, methods, statuses, and truncated bodies).
# This helps later implement a direct-API ("nuclear") accept flow.
# ACCEPT_TRACE=1

# Optional: control when traces are sent.
# Defaults: failure = ON, success = OFF.
# ACCEPT_TRACE_SEND_ON_FAILURE=1
# ACCEPT_TRACE_SEND_ON_SUCCESS=1

# Optional (advanced / risky): also save an UNREDACTED trace locally to disk.
# This contains cookies/tokens and should never be shared.
# Saved under: checker/accept_traces/
# ACCEPT_TRACE_SAVE_UNREDACTED_LOCAL=1

# --- Optional: Google Sheets logging (batched; non-blocking) ---
# Create a Google Sheet, then share it with your Service Account email.
# Provide the spreadsheet ID and service account JSON (base64 preferred).
#
# GOOGLE_SHEETS_ID=1AbC...yourSpreadsheetId...
# GOOGLE_SHEETS_TAB=Jobs
# GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON_BASE64=...
# Optional tuning:
# GOOGLE_SHEETS_FLUSH_MS=1000
# GOOGLE_SHEETS_BATCH_SIZE=25

# Dedupe window for Sheets rows (prevents spamming duplicate rows on refresh).
# Dedupes by (jobId + status) for this many ms.
# SHEETS_DEDUPE_WINDOW_MS=30000

# Test mode: enqueue dummy rows (all statuses) to Sheets and exit.
# Useful to verify credentials + formatting quickly.
# SHEETS_TEST_MODE=1

# Flood guard: if a single available-requests response contains more than this many jobs,
# the bot switches to CHECK ONLY mode for the rest of the run (no auto-accept).
# MAX_JOBS_PER_CHECK_BEFORE_CHECK_ONLY=20

# --- Optional: job dedupe window ---
# Prevents re-triggering/logging the same still-visible jobs on every refresh.
# (Allows reprocessing after the window.)
# JOBS_DEDUPE_WINDOW_MS=30000
